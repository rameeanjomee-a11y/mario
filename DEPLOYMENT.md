## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Using deploy.sh script
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual deployment
```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Multi-game platform: Mario & Ninja Frogs with remote controllers"

# Push to repository
git push origin main
```

## üìã What Gets Deployed

The Dockerfile will copy:
- `server.js` - Main server file with multi-session support
- `controller.html` - Mario controller with session ID support
- `controller2.html` - Ninja Frogs P1 controller with session ID support
- `controller3.html` - Ninja Frogs P2 controller with session ID support
- `FullScreenMario-master/` - Mario game files with session ID support
- `games/` - All additional games (Ninja Frogs) with session ID support
- `MULTIPLAYER_SESSIONS.md` - Multi-session feature documentation
- `package.json` & `package-lock.json` - Dependencies

## üåê Platform-Specific Notes

### Liara (Current Setup)
- Uses `liara.json` for configuration
- Port 3000 is configured
- Will auto-deploy from GitHub

### Railway / Render / Heroku
- Will auto-detect `Dockerfile`
- No additional configuration needed
- Ensure PORT environment variable is supported (already configured)

### Docker Compose (Local/VPS)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## üîç Verify Deployment

After deployment, test these URLs (replace with your domain):

### Mario Game (Legacy - Default Session)
- Controller: `https://your-domain.com/controller`
- Game: `https://your-domain.com/mario`

### Mario Game (Multi-Session Mode)
- Session 1 Game: `https://your-domain.com/mario?id=123`
- Session 1 Controller: `https://your-domain.com/controller?id=123`
- Session 2 Game: `https://your-domain.com/mario?id=124`
- Session 2 Controller: `https://your-domain.com/controller?id=124`

### Ninja Frogs Game (Legacy - Default Session)
- Controller P1 (Green): `https://your-domain.com/controller2`
- Controller P2 (Purple): `https://your-domain.com/controller3`
- Game: `https://your-domain.com/frogs`

### Ninja Frogs Game (Multi-Session Mode)
- Session 1 Game: `https://your-domain.com/frogs?id=abc`
- Session 1 Controller P1: `https://your-domain.com/controller2?id=abc`
- Session 1 Controller P2: `https://your-domain.com/controller3?id=abc`
- Session 2 Game: `https://your-domain.com/frogs?id=xyz`
- Session 2 Controller P1: `https://your-domain.com/controller2?id=xyz`
- Session 2 Controller P2: `https://your-domain.com/controller3?id=xyz`

**See `MULTIPLAYER_SESSIONS.md` for complete documentation on the multi-session feature!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **WebSocket Support**: Ensure your hosting platform supports WebSocket connections
2. **HTTPS**: Controllers work better with HTTPS (especially on mobile)
3. **Port**: The app uses port 3000 by default (configurable via PORT env variable)
4. **File Size**: Ninja Frogs game is ~64MB, ensure your platform supports larger deployments
5. **Multi-Session Feature**: Multiple users can now play simultaneously using unique session IDs (e.g., `?id=123`)
6. **Session Isolation**: Each session ID creates an isolated room - controls from one session won't affect another
7. **Backward Compatibility**: URLs without session IDs still work (use "default" session)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If games don't load:
1. Check server logs for any missing files
2. Verify all files were copied in Docker build
3. Check browser console for 404 errors

### If controllers don't connect:
1. Verify WebSocket is working (check browser console)
2. Ensure HTTPS is enabled for production
3. Check firewall/security group settings

### If Player 2 controller doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for keyboard event logs
2. Verify the game canvas has focus
3. Test with keyboard first (Arrow keys + Ctrl/Shift)

### If multi-session doesn't work (controls affect wrong game):
1. Verify both game and controller use the **same session ID**
2. Check browser console for session ID logs (should show on connection)
3. Check server console for room creation logs (e.g., "Created new room: mario:123")
4. Try using a different, unique session ID to test isolation

## üìù Environment Variables

Optional environment variables:
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment (set to 'production' in Dockerfile)

## ‚ú® Success Criteria

‚úÖ Server starts without errors
‚úÖ All game URLs are accessible
‚úÖ All controller URLs are accessible
‚úÖ WebSocket connections establish successfully
‚úÖ Controllers can control their respective games
‚úÖ Both players can play Ninja Frogs simultaneously
‚úÖ Multi-session feature works (different session IDs don't interfere)
‚úÖ Session isolation is maintained (controls only affect their own session)
‚úÖ Backward compatibility works (URLs without session IDs use "default" session)

---

**Ready to deploy!** All files are configured and the platform will work on any hosting service that supports Node.js and WebSockets. The new multi-session feature allows unlimited simultaneous games using unique session IDs!
