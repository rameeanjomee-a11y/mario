# Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

All necessary files are now configured for deployment:

### Updated Files
- ‚úÖ `Dockerfile` - Updated to include all game files
- ‚úÖ `package.json` - Updated version to 2.0.0
- ‚úÖ `server.js` - Multi-game support with WebSocket rooms
- ‚úÖ `deploy.sh` - Updated deployment script
- ‚úÖ `.dockerignore` - Already properly configured

### New Files Added
- ‚úÖ `controller2.html` - Ninja Frogs Player 1 controller (Green)
- ‚úÖ `controller3.html` - Ninja Frogs Player 2 controller (Purple)
- ‚úÖ `games/frogs/` - Ninja Frogs game files
- ‚úÖ `MULTI_GAME_SETUP.md` - Documentation
- ‚úÖ `DEPLOYMENT.md` - This file

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Using deploy.sh script
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual deployment
```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Multi-game platform: Mario & Ninja Frogs with remote controllers"

# Push to repository
git push origin main
```

## üìã What Gets Deployed

The Dockerfile will copy:
- `server.js` - Main server file
- `controller.html` - Mario controller
- `controller2.html` - Ninja Frogs P1 controller
- `controller3.html` - Ninja Frogs P2 controller
- `FullScreenMario-master/` - Mario game files
- `games/` - All additional games (Ninja Frogs)
- `package.json` & `package-lock.json` - Dependencies

## üåê Platform-Specific Notes

### Liara (Current Setup)
- Uses `liara.json` for configuration
- Port 3000 is configured
- Will auto-deploy from GitHub

### Railway / Render / Heroku
- Will auto-detect `Dockerfile`
- No additional configuration needed
- Ensure PORT environment variable is supported (already configured)

### Docker Compose (Local/VPS)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## üîç Verify Deployment

After deployment, test these URLs (replace with your domain):

### Mario Game
- Controller: `https://your-domain.com/controller`
- Game: `https://your-domain.com/mario`

### Ninja Frogs Game
- Controller P1 (Green): `https://your-domain.com/controller2`
- Controller P2 (Purple): `https://your-domain.com/controller3`
- Game: `https://your-domain.com/frogs`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **WebSocket Support**: Ensure your hosting platform supports WebSocket connections
2. **HTTPS**: Controllers work better with HTTPS (especially on mobile)
3. **Port**: The app uses port 3000 by default (configurable via PORT env variable)
4. **File Size**: Ninja Frogs game is ~64MB, ensure your platform supports larger deployments

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If games don't load:
1. Check server logs for any missing files
2. Verify all files were copied in Docker build
3. Check browser console for 404 errors

### If controllers don't connect:
1. Verify WebSocket is working (check browser console)
2. Ensure HTTPS is enabled for production
3. Check firewall/security group settings

### If Player 2 controller doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for keyboard event logs
2. Verify the game canvas has focus
3. Test with keyboard first (Arrow keys + Ctrl/Shift)

## üìù Environment Variables

Optional environment variables:
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment (set to 'production' in Dockerfile)

## ‚ú® Success Criteria

‚úÖ Server starts without errors
‚úÖ All game URLs are accessible
‚úÖ All controller URLs are accessible
‚úÖ WebSocket connections establish successfully
‚úÖ Controllers can control their respective games
‚úÖ Both players can play Ninja Frogs simultaneously

---

**Ready to deploy!** All files are configured and the platform will work on any hosting service that supports Node.js and WebSockets.
